# DbUpMigrations using DbUp Library
DbUp is a .NET library that helps in order to deploy changes to SQL Server databases. It keeps track on which SQL scripts have been run already, and runs the scripts that are needed in order to get your database up to date.

The current custom implementation is a straightforward approach to run all scripts at once. Additionally, it features a menu that helps us perform various tasks with the library.
